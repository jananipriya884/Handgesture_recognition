# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition System

This project is a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It enables the system to recognize and track human hands, allowing interaction based on hand gestures — laying the foundation for gesture-controlled applications.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking using webcam
- High-accuracy landmark detection with MediaPipe
- Visual hand landmark overlay on video frames
- Easily extendable for custom gesture recognition

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
